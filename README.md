# Bioinformatics Notes: Lesson 1



### 1.Gene：Coding & Noncoding

---



#### 1.1 What is a Gene and Genome?

**Gene: **a segment of DNA that ==contains instructions for building a specific protein or performing a particular function in an organism's body.==

**Genome: **the complete set of an organism's DNA,==including all of its genes and non-coding regions,== providing the genetic instructions for the structure and functioning of that organism.



#### 1.2 Which organism has the ==largest== genome? 

​	**Amoeba**, 670 Gpb

#### 1.3 Why Do Humans Have So Few Genes?

**One possible reason is:**

​		Because we have only considered the coding portion, in fact, ==the vast majority of the content in the genome is non-coding.==

### 2.Method: Sequencing & Computing

#### 2.1 Sequencing Technologies

**The history and development of sequencing technologies:**

1. **Sanger Sequencing (1970s-2000s):**
   - First widely used method for DNA sequencing.
   - Relatively slow and expensive, limited to shorter DNA fragments.
2. **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS, 2000s-Present):**
   - Revolutionized genomics with high-throughput, parallel sequencing.
   - Enabled faster, cost-effective sequencing of entire genomes.
   - Examples include Illumina sequencing, 454 sequencing, and SOLiD sequencing.
3. **Third-Generation Sequencing (Present and Beyond):**
   - Emerging technologies like PacBio and Oxford Nanopore offer long-read sequencing.
   - Capable of sequencing longer DNA fragments, aiding genome assembly and structural variation analysis.
   - Reducing the need for PCR amplification and improving sequencing accuracy.
4. **Single-Cell Sequencing (Recent Years):**
   - Focuses on analyzing individual cells within a heterogeneous population.
   - Enables insights into cellular diversity and rare cell types.
   - Applications in fields like cancer research and developmental biology.



**How to make the content of bioinformatics analysis more **==**comprehensive**==?  \==> **Big and HD (High\-dimensional) data**

#### 2.2 Three steps of Bioinformatics

1. **Information** (Biological data or results that can extract certain quantitative or qualitative features.)

   **Examples:**

   - Medical Images

   - Sequencing data

   - Experimental results

   - etc.

2. **Model** (a mathematical or statistical representation used to describe or predict real-world phenomena.)

   **Examples:**

   - Regression Model

   - Tree Model

   - Neural Network Model

   - etc.

3. **Algorithm** (a step-by-step set of instructions or a defined process for solving a specific computational problem.)

   **Exmaples:**

   - Dynamic Programming
   - A Search Algorithm
   - Insertion Sort
   - etc.

#### 2.3 The differences between Model and Algorithm

**Algorithm:**

- Defined set of steps for a specific task.
- Executes tasks like sorting, searching, data processing.
- Typically static, doesn't learn or adapt from data.
- Used for algorithmic navigation, image processing, numerical computation, etc.

**Model:**

- Mathematical or statistical representation.
- Describes data or system behavior.
- Often has learning and adaptation capabilities.
- Used for predictions, classifications, pattern recognition (e.g., linear regression, neural networks, decision trees).
